## Available Code Samples

### **1. Printable Route Directions (Available Now)**

#### Description:
This code sample demonstrates how to generate **Printable Route Directions** using Geoapify's Routing API and Static Maps API with JavaScript and HTML. It includes interactive features and static content generation for detailed route instructions.

#### Features:
- **Turn-by-Turn Instructions:** Generate step-by-step instructions with icons, distances, and times.
- **Static Route Preview:** Create a static map image of the entire route using a **POST request**.
- **Step Previews:** Generate dynamic step-by-step map visuals with bearings and directional arrows.
- **Route Elevation Profile:** Render an elevation chart using elevation data from the Routing API.

#### APIs Used:
- [Geoapify Routing API](https://www.geoapify.com/routing-api/)
- [Geoapify Static Maps API](https://www.geoapify.com/static-maps-api/)

## Upcoming Code Samples

We plan to expand this repository with code samples in various programming languages, demonstrating different Geoapify APIs, including:

1. **Geocoding and Address Lookup:**
   - Forward and reverse geocoding examples.
   - Address validation and standardization.

2. **Isochrones API:**
   - Create travel-time or distance-based areas.
   - Use cases for accessibility analysis and service area mapping.

3. **POI Search API:**
   - Find points of interest near a location.
   - Filter results by categories, names, or other attributes.

4. **Interactive and Static Maps:**
   - Generate and style static maps.
   - Integrate dynamic interactive maps using Geoapify map tiles.

5. **Multi-Language Code Samples:**
   - Examples in **JavaScript**, **Python**, **Node.js**, **Java**, **C#**, and more.
